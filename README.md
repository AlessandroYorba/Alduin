# Alduin #

A dark low-contrast Vim colorscheme for Terminal Vim and GUI Vim. 

### Inspiration ###

The idea behind Alduin was to create a dark colorscheme that combined warm yet soft colors for high readability with low distraction. Some of the features, and design cues pay homage to schemes like Jeet Sukumaran's [Sorcerer](http://jeetworks.org/sorcerer/), Ciaran McCreesh's [Inkpot](https://github.com/ciaranm/inkpot), as well as Romain Lafourcade's [Apprentice](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice), and Steve Losh's [Badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf).


## Custom Options / Shouts ##


#### Windhelm ####

Default color for the 'Special' highlight group is a deep red called Sahloknir. The hex value is `af0000` and the term color is `124`. See the following example:

If you're not a fan of Sahloknir then you might enjoy the color Windhelm; hex value `af5f5f` term color `131`. It's a  softer hue for all of you milk drinkers out there. See the following example:

If you add the following code to your vimrc before you declare the colorscheme, Sahloknir is replaced with the color Windhelm

        let g:alduin_Shout_Windhelm = 1


#### AuraWhisper ####

Default color and behavior for the 'MatchParen' highlight group:

If you add the following code to your vimrc before you declare the colorscheme, 'MatchParen' will be underlined with a white forground. 

        let g:alduin_Shout_AuraWhisper = 1
